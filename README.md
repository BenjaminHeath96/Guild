## What would I have improved on if more time
- Ability to chat with multiple people
    - If I had 1 more hour:
        - Server would have stored chat history in a dictionary, so we can track conversation easily between multiple users.
        - Frontend would have had different collapses to show different conversations
    - If I had more time:
        - Server would have used a real database.
        - Frontend would have used something more elegant than collapses
